# You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
# You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
# Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: cost = [10,15,20]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: You will start at index 1.
# - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
# The total cost is 15.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: You will start at index 0.
# - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
# - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
# - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
# - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
# - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
# - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
# The total cost is 6.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
# 0 <= cost[i] <= 999
