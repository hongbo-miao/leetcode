# You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
# Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
# Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [3,4,2]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
# - Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
# - Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
# You earn a total of 6 points.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
# - Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
# - Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
# - Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
# You earn a total of 9 points.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
