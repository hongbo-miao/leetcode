# Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
# Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
# Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1]
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
# Output: [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1]
#
# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
# The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
#
# Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
